As 2023 came to an end, I decided to read some 2023 predictions online that were made at the end of 2022. A few were right, many were close, and the rest were either wrong or too broad to be useful.

Good predictions are hard to make. When it comes to tech, it’s easy to overestimate something now but underestimate it later. So, an accurate prediction for 2024 might be that tech predictions will be wrong. That’s not very interesting though, so I tried to make a list of predictions for 2024 that I think will be interesting to look back at in a year.

#### There will be an open-weight multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLM

We have Mixtral-8x7B right now but it only takes text. GPT-4V exists but is closed. Soon, there might be a downloadable multimodal LLM that uses a MoE architecture.

#### Magnific-like enhancement will be available for video

Magnific.ai (and Krea.ai) are “upscaling” tools that enhance an image by not just increasing its resolution but also introducing new, AI-generated details. They employ a different method from usual super resolution, and work more like “reimagining” the image. The same technique will be applied to video upscaling, and once spatial/temporal dependencies are figured out a service will be launched making it available for everyone. It’s also likely that the reimagining technique will be used on more focused applications.

#### Apple will finally be applying generative AI in its software

Siri will be upgraded with a Transformer model and will be multimodal. Apple will also put AI-powered image manipulation tools in its OS's.

#### End-to-end virtual assistants

Current assistants you can talk to (Alexa, Google Assistant, ChatGPT, etc.) are pipelines that involve using speech-to-text and text-to-speech with something in between. It has been this way for a while, but the final state that virtual assistants would evolve into is a single end-to-end Transformer-like model that works fully in the audio domain. I don’t think this will happen in 2024, but I’ll include it here anyway.
