About a year ago at the end of 2023, I made a list of AI-related developments that I thought would happen in 2024. Now that it’s the end of 2024, here are my predictions for 2025.

- OpenAI will reveal a SOTA [foundation world model](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/)
- [Open-weights](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi) [end-to-end](https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavChat?tab=readme-ov-file#2-general-classification-of-spoken-dialogue-systems) [spoken dialogue models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16502.pdf) will scale past 70B parameters and match the current performance of OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode
- AI [video](https://klingai.com/) [generator](https://www.vidu.studio/) [services](https://hailuoai.video/) will add features allowing generated videos to have audio
- Some LLMs will be implemented with more dynamic ways to interleave reasoning for [inference time compute](https://openai.com/o1/)
- There will be an open-weights text-to-image model competitive with [Flux](https://blackforestlabs.ai/announcing-flux-1-1-pro-and-the-bfl-api/) that will not be diffusion-based (e.g. next-token prediction)
